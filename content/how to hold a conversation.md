- it's like a juggling bean bag game! Up to everyone 
1. be interested, don't be interesting (reduces pressure. You just need to be interested in what's going on)
2. give yourself permission to pause (to give an appropriate response)
	1. "tell me more"
3. connection not perfection. You can make mistakes
4. concision is best
	1. have structure: logical connection of your points
5. tell me the time, don't build me the clock
6. What?, so what?, now what? <-- drill it so it becomes more natural
7. initiate good questions: notice things in the environment. "Hi how are you" gets you no where
8. How to get out of small talk
	1. white flag approach
	2. "I need to get going, but before I go I need to know..." <-- clean way to end conversation
