- vegetable oils are [[Lipids and triglycerides|triglycerides]].
- triglycerides are derived from fatty acids and glycerol (think 3 alcohols chained together)
- a fatty acid is just a carboxylic acid
- you want to perform transesterification to break down viscous vegetable oils into more manageable hydrocarbons to use in engines as biodiesel!
