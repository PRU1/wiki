part of problem solving [[Strategies for solving problems|problem solving]] is being able to present your solution.

From https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/proofs/writingtips.pdf are a list of writing suggestions 
# notation
1. do not start sentences with numbers or symbols
	i.e. instead of 
		one solution we can use is $f(x)=\sin x$. $f(x)$ is...
	use
		one solution we can use is $f(x)=\sin x$. In this case, $f(x)$...
2. use notation that fits the context
	i.e. let $p$ be a prime rather than let $m$ be a prime
3. define new notation and be specific

4. avoid using technical notation unless it is a must
		i.e. there $\exists$ an integer $n$ ... | do this instead: there is some integer $n$...
5. be concise, avoid introducing stuff where you don't need to
		"every differentiable function $f$ is continuous" --> "all differentiable functions are continuous"
# equations and expressions
1. equations $\neq$ expressions
2. label important equations (but not every step in its derivation)
3. add punctuation after equations if needed

# parentheses and commas
1. do not have redundant parentheses
2. ![[Pasted image 20240619145615.png]]
3. for if.. then statements, separate the ideas with a period.

4. tell the reader what you are doing
5. don't writing boring (vary word choice!)
# english
1. use parallel structure
	i.e. if Milo ate real numbers, then he would also eat transcendental numbers and prime numbers --> if Milo ate real numbers, then he would also eat transcendental and prime numbers
