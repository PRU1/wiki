- don't go through addition reaction
	- disturbs aromatic structure
	- Also aromatic structure is stable! 
	- To break structure uses lots of energy
	- also no longer an aromatic compound
- electrophiles attracted to pi electrons

[[Huckel orbitals]] describe conditions for aromaticity

$$\ce{Cl2}+\ce{C_{6}H_{6}}$$
--> need a halogen carrier catalyst
