draft: "true"

purpose: I don't think I did anything this year :(. Hopefully this serves as some motivation and identifies ways to improve for the New Year!

## Yay!
- level 7 in math + physics (how... I do not know...)
- NRGHacks! (figure out how to organize meetings better... )
- Learned about neural networks!
	- backpropagation
	- learned a bit of linear algebra
	- learned a bit of multivariable calc
- learned I can learn cp rather quickly... just got to do it
- Can much more confidently address a crowd
- I am much more patient and don't lose temper easily (has gotten even better I suppose)
- Milo walks significantly better now
- I don't eat lunch alone anymore (yay)

## Things that could've gone better
- I get distracted too easily
- Level 5 in English (just when I had started getting 7s in English I dropped ouch)
- broke my level 7 streak on chemistry tests (NRGHacks took over my life, but I didn't get a 7 because I didn't read the question properly..... ouch ......... no more excuses)
- didn't learn that much programming
- I could have learned MUCH more if I didn't waste so much time
- It appears I have partially lost the ability to write concisely, as evident by my initial drafts for university essays
- Didn't read a lot from Daddy's bookshelf
