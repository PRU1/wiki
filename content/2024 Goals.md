This is a response to [[2023 year in review]]. 

## Big picture goal: 
learn a lot and do something useful (right now helping with CAS project to help students with special needs learn)

## Long Term Goals
- spend at least 30-60 minutes every day learning (10 years, when I'm out of school)
- Build a personal wiki and create website: inspiration: stevengong.co/ (4 years)
- Do a masters and maybe PhD too (research sounds fun!) (8 years)
- Get a dog so Milo and dog can go on playdates (10 years)
- Take Milo training so he is friendly with all doggies (4 years)
## Smaller goals
- get a level 7 in French and Chemistry and English
	- CHEMISTRY: already have a 7 :D. Just be curious and learn to think
	- English: Do mock P1s. Read Thomas' P1. Read my old P1. Ask teacher for feedback. Read Hamlet so I can nail the HL Essay --> has to argue thesis and present novel ideas (i.e. not immediately apparent. Give implication and show literary devices support it)
	- French: Listen to Scilabus every day, read French novels
- Finish EE
	- welp. Should've been done by now....
- Get into UofT Engineering Science
- Get UofT National Scholarship
- Ace CCC (start prepping for that on Jan. 2). Practice every day!

My 2024 Toolkit:
- FOCUS and DISCIPLINE
	- I need to be able to sit down and FINISH something.... this is something I have been struggling with
	- DISCIPLINE: doing the things I do not want to do. I do not have fun subjects anymore so I procrastinate doing everything (chem is a bit better, but it's not like physics welp). How to become more disciplined: put a stake to a task, work on timers with some reward at the end (like wasting time)
