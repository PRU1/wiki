# about models
1. no models are perfect --> reality is too complicated. include simplifications
2. different models tell you different things about the same situation
3. some models predict, some models explain (i.e. why do older people fall more)
## model of engineering
- there is reality (objective) and theory (represent reality in a way we can understand it)
a theory is how we understand the world

### hoover dam model / model of engineering
baddddd

engineers make decisions ---> and engineers recommend designs
you are making an argument every time you dream to create something --> communication


you are making a lot of arguments at every stage in the design process![[Pasted image 20240906113832.png]]

engineering decisions and recommendations require justification

## Toulmin's Structure of Argument
![[Pasted image 20240906114447.png]]
**evidence** is something that supports your claim
**justification** demonstrates that the claim supports the evidence
**qualifier** acknowledge the limitations of your arguments | limits the scope of your argument
**counterclaim** something that refutes your claim, and you explain why the counterclaim is invalid
