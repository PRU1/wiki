### What's an inverse kinematics model?
- You have a robotic arm that you want to move to some position in space. 
- An inverse kinematic model determines the joint angles to move the robot to the inputted position.

--> arranging the arms in this arrangement makes the mathematics simpler
- In this arrangement, one angle is 90 degrees and the other two are equal (makes it simple to calculate the angles). Try using this for the demo
- If given length of arm you can calculate for the angles to maintain a 45 degree angle (google SSS triangle if help is needed)
