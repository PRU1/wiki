- 98% of sun energy is emitted as heat and light
- rest comes out as x-rays and gamma rays
	- energy released when light nuclei fuse to form a heavy nuclei. mass defect turns into energy released
	- see [[nuclear fusion in the sun]]


## Ways to collect solar energy
- heat up water (passive collection) 
- thermal (active collection) --> sun's heat used to bring an endothermic change

	-> what does this mean..... 
- photovoltaic cells and DSSC cells

## Photosynthesis
### Chromophores - a coloured compound
- groups of molecules containing double bonds or benzene rings (C=C, C=O) absorb visible light and ultraviolet
	- why?
these compounds are called chromophores
#### Conjugated systems
- alternating single and double bonds in a molecule
- ![[Pasted image 20240404194001.png]]benzene ring is a conjugated system

- the longer the conjugate system, the longer the wavelength of light is absorbed
- 8 double bonds in a conjugate system and it will be coloured (absorbs light in the visible spectrum)
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">is conjugated systems only with hydrocarbons</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">why longer bonds needed?</mark>
