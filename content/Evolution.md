condition for evolution 
1. self replication
	- where did the first come from? we do not know
2. every creature born needs a blueprint
	- genomes in nature! information in genetic information that gets passed on generation to generation. DNA and RNA are chemical storage
![[Pasted image 20240127220313.png]]
- chemical components of DNA ^
- we can represent genomes with a bunch of lettersq
3. Inherent 
4. Mutation
	1. every replica in nature is not an exact replica of the parents
5. Selection
	1. who gets to reproduce and who doesn't 
		- in nature this is called natural selection (i.e. get food, avoid getting hit by thunder, being socially adept)
About the simulation

how evolution works
	- whatever reproduces, reproduces; whatever doesn't, doesn't. (i.e. stuff that fails does not end up reproducing)
- evolution converts randomness into order and complexity
	- mutations!
