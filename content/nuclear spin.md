nuclear spin is a quantum mechanical property, related to the angular momentum of a charge 

essentially, nuclei behave as if they spin (they have not been observed to spin) and a spinning/moving charge has a magnetic field (magnetic moment!) that points in a certain direction.

when you apply a magnetic field to a sample of nuclei, the magnetic moments align with the field 

either in the same direction or opposite direction
