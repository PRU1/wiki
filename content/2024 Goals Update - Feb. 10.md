[[2024 Goals Update - Feb 1st]]
- somehow got into Eng Sci yippiee!!
- very excited to go there but I still have 7 months to go before I get to study there
- very excited and looking over UofT stuff (including their reddit) is wasting my day (probably spent around 10 hours just waiting for a new message to pop up.................................... (this is an exaggeration but it illustrates the effect)).
- I'm SOOOO CLOSE to finishing my EE but I'm just not doing it. Also got to do CCC prep. Also got to play with Milo. I'm wasting my entire day womp

**Brain drop:**:
- reduce frequency of checking eng sci 2T8 discord --> maybe only check once at end of day when I'm bored
- I can have Discord running in the background but I got to get used to not opening it. I should leave it open and forget I have it open (or just go invisible)
	- how to resist urge to check it? --> realistically I'm not missing anything *really* important by not checking it. I didn't touch Discord for 4 hours today (challenged myself) and didn't receive a bunch of messages. it's more of getting in a conversation that is a plethora of messages 
- in general, I do not have goals anymore. My goal for the past 5 month has been to get into uni (probably not the best idea but it was on my mind) and now that it's accomplished I don't really have a purpose to do anything.
- Conclusion: must shift my goals to what they were originally - TO LEARN : D. do things because they are cool and can (hopefully) help someone someday. I think this mindset can compensate for my seemingly minute discipline. 
- on the bright side (just prior to getting accepted to Eng Sci) I did make significant improving reducing the amount of time wasted at my desk, scrolling through random webpages. I miss the old, more curious me. Curious not about getting into uni but learning (ironically this trait made getting 7 in math+physics attainable womp womp)

**Next steps:**
- Getting into UofT Eng Sci slumber is over. 
- I want to learn and pursue excellence.
- EE done tomorrow morning, as well as HL essay by around lunch time
- Then learn organic chem....
- Also find some time for CAS
- Also find time for CCC prep
- Also practice violin and trombone?
- GET TO WORK AHHHHHHHHHHH

(funny how I'll wake up early to do this, but random googling about potential future has drained me...)
