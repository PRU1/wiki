light nuclei turn into usually light, stable nuclei, not radioactive

- disadvantage: have to overcome Coulomb repulsion (lots of energy to start fusion, with fission you only have to shoot neutrons)
	- ram two light nuclei at high speeds
	- or increase temperature because that increases the probability that two nuclei are close to each other 
	- for fusing Neon nuclei, that's like 10$^{11}$ K

simplest fusion
$$ \text {p + p} \to \ce{^2He}$$
- this is not possible, because $\ce{^2He}$ is unstable (no neutrons to "bind" the nucleus together) -> but it occurs in the sun....

- large energy release reaction (also release neutron?)
$$\ce{^2H}+\ce{^3H}\to\ce{^4He}+\ce{n}$$
