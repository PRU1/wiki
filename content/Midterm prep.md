Requirements framework --> 

1) use your research to develop a requirements framework that will enable you to assess your device according to 3 objectives
2) prioritize your objectives. be prepared to defend your reasoning


Needs - why
Goals - what must be done 
Objectives - how you will do it (i.e. expectations of the product)

Design criteria - measurable

Need: create a blender to create fruit smoothy
goal: (i) should be safe, (ii) portable, and (iii) powerful
Requirements
- cannot be accidentally triggered (includes two ))
- should be light (<1 kg)
- operating with standard household plug
- black colour
- the motor should produce *x* horsepower
	- use AC motor
- operating volume under 40 dB


Studio teardown:
types of resources
1. Reference designs
2. Codes, standards, intellectual properties
3. Handbooks, textbooks, DfX


Part 2
use requirements framework to evaluate the device
- and compare to a reference design

write out 3 arguments addressing how your device exhibits
# Reference designs
- article in popular media about a similar/same device
- customer review
- full patent for the product

# Codes and standards
- full-text code, standard, regulation associated with symbol on production

# Handbooks, textbooks, DfX
- Books covering DfSafety, DfUsability, DfManufacturing
- explain how DfXs influence the design of the product
- Design alternatives



# Stuff to find out about 
- DfEnvironment
- EU regulations? 
- get model number
- DfUsability
- DfReparability --> i.e. type of fastener


Thinking about design intentions
- you are going bottom-up, i.e. something already built to figure out why they made it like that --> reverse engineering

Elements of a requirement and evaluation criteria

Goal:

example of a good requirement: all plastics used shall contain >80% bio-renewably sourced materials as determined by ASTM D 6866-22
aspect/property: plastic composition
metric: % of bio-renewably sourced materials
constraint: metric should be <80%

the constraint determines the shape of the utility curve


i.e. Billy bookshelf
Goal: easy to assemble
Objective: should minimize the number of tools required (i.e. look at DfAssembly)
Requirement: all fasteners should require #2 Phillips screwdriver

engineers make decisions and recommend designs


core thing to create a argument: a claim --> evidence --> justifications

- note: the more evidence and justification we have, the claim is shifted towards ground
- think of it like a loop

counterclaims are not referenced directly in a report. Use counterclaims to form arguments

ideally objectives have metrics, but for the purposes of Praxis, you do not need to include them. Requirements and EC should be specific though

ground is stuff you assume your audience agrees with --> no need to restate it in your argument. Ground can act as evidence.

review the CRAAP test

qualifier -> something that limits the scope of your argument

study plan
- review lecture notes
	- review CRAAP test
- then go through each lecture slides and answer the bubble questions
- use chatgpt for reinforcement
