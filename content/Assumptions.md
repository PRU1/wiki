When dealing with the [[classification]] of data, we make assumptions about the source data. Namely:
- data is independent and identically distributed 
- the data are generated by a [[Markov chain]] 
- "the process generating the data might be adversial" (MIT open courseware)
- the model generating data can be described perfectly with some set of hypotheses

we make these assumptions to reduce the set space of possible hypotheses. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be parsed to make a hypothesis
