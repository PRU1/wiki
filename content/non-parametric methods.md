rather than [[parametric methods]] which assume a function that models a dataset, non-parametric methods assume no function

it just tries to find the best model to fit the data set

advantage: you can get really good results, because you find the best function to model data.
disadvantage: slow (because you have to test out a bunch of functions)

you can also get overfitting (your function fits to noise)

- it's easier to interpret low flexibility models (i.e. [[parametric methods]])
