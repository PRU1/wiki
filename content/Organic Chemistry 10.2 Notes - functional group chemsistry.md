[[Organic Chemistry Naming Miscellaneous Notes]]


- alkanes are most stable because strong C-H and C-C bonds (412 kJ and 348 kJ /mol respectively)
- why is C-H bond stronger than C-C? 
	- could it be something about sigma bond in C-C being more spread out because of sp$^3$ hybridization?
	- ans: distance between nuclei is smaller with a C-H bond, so it is stronger
- strong bonds and polar molecules means that alkanes are not very reactive. 
- Go through 2 types of reactions
- COMBUSTION - exothermic reaction
	- large amount of energy released in forming double bonds of CO2

## Halogenation
- yoink a halogen into an alkane (substitute a $\ce{H}$ ; it's a ![[substitution reaction]])

- need UV to break C-H bond:
![[E=hv]]
- you need a nickel catalyst. why a nickel catalyst?
	- Nickel
