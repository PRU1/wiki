When we did the studio teardown (see [[Reflections]]), we can go backwards in the design process.

# Looking at previous designs
[Google patents](patents.google.com) --> good for looking at reference designs
# How to write
- write first draft without thinking. rewrite after thinking
## how to start writing?
- free write

example of free writing: prompt: what did you learn about your teardown device this week:

This week I teared down an old blender. I had previously opened it, so had some insight into its design choices, but did not think about DfXs, in particular. Some initial observations that were repeated this second time opening, was that there are two limit switches held by plastic prongs. Both these most be depressed to turn on the blender. This is a safety feature; it makes it difficult to accidentally trigger the blender without the correct blender size. Interestingly, there were 3 prongs but only 2 limit switches. I first thought this was lazy, or perhaps to save money, but it could also be a reliability feature. 2 switches are less likely to fail than 3. Something new I noticed was these tiny metal rods, held in by springs, that touched the metal part of the motor. I know a little about motors, and that a solid iron rod is used to increase magnetic flux.
