[[Organic Chemistry Naming Miscellaneous Notes]]
- C's ability to link to itself is called catenation
- reason why we have so many organic compounds
- There are things called functional groups which change the properties of organic molecules. They also make a molecule more reactive
- Saturated reactant: only contains single bonds
- Unsaturated: alkenes, alkynes, arenes

**Terms**:
Aliphatic: compounds that do not contain a benzene ring
Arenes: compounds that contain benzene rings
Electrophile: Electron deficient; electron acceptor
Nucleophile: Electron donator (ligand! lewis base!)
Addition reaction: combine two reactants to form a single product
Substitution: Replace one atom or group of atoms with another
Addition-elimination: you add two things and something is lost

**Types of bond breaking**
fission: since breaking bond
## *homolytic fission*:
covalent bond breaks and splits shared electron pair between two products
## *heterolytic* *fission*: 
covalent bond splits and an electron pair is transferred (technically not precise but sufficient for now)

**Homologous Series:** have the same general formula
**Structural isomers**: same molecular formula but different arrangement of atoms

## Homologous series of alkanes:

- for bigger molecule, boiling point increases (larger LDF)  -> also access density and viscosity

**Structural isomers**: same molecular formula but different structures/arrangements of molecules
what about benzene makes it a carcinogen?

Evidence that suggest benzene delocalized electrons:
- C-C bonds of equal length; somewhere between single and double bond lengths
- Benzene has a more stable structure; expand/learn
- Reluctant to undergo addition reactions; more likely to go through substitution reactions
