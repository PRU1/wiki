- take a bunch of data
- aggregate it to make a prediction
	- robotics!
	- predictions of what a good action to take would be
	- taking data and using it do some job

you have to be able to measure how well you do a job (reward, cost functions!)
people were trying to right programs to find faces in images
- mostly didn't work very well

ML deals with fitting models as a means to make good predictions or decisions

## Role of humans
Humans have to frame the problem
- getting the data and organizing the data

ML deals with solving two types of problems
**estimation** (make predictions) and **generalization** (classify data neve seem before)


# Types of ML
[[Transformers]]
[[Recurrent Neural Networks]]
