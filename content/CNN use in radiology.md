## review of CNN
- can find "spatial hierarchies of features" in images
- essentially, used to find patterns in images.
- processes data that has a grid pattern to it, such as images.
- inspired by animal visual cortex
- has 3 layers/building block: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- Convolution and pooling perform feature extraction. The fully connected layer is essentially a classifier (output of CNN)
- in the convolutional layer, you perform [[convolution]] which is a linear operation that calculates the overlap of two functions as you shift one (I think)
## introduction
- people are using CNNs on [[diabetic retinopathy]] screening
