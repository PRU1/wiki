- find out how the reaction works
- Reaction equation: $$\displaystyle\ce{6CO2}+\ce{6H2O}\to \ce{C6H12O6}+\ce{6O2}$$
- takes $\ce{CO2}$ and converts it into complex molecules, like glucose. Glucose used to form structural molecules (cellulose)
Note: $\ce{C6H12O6}$ is called glucose
energy is absorbed during photosynthesis, it is endothermic
