[[Acids and bases]] [[Predicting Acid-Base reactions]]

# amphiprotic
- can act both as a Bronsted-Lowry acid and base
- Recall Brownsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor. Base is a proton acceptor. 
- to be amphiprotic, you need somewhere where a proton can attach to. you also need an $\ce{H+}$ that can leave.![[Pasted image 20240430102025.png]]
# amphoteric
- can react to form an acid or base, depending on what it is reacted with
## Aluminium oxide
- reaction with sulfuric acid (behaves like a base)
$\ce{Al2O3(s) + 6H+ -> 2Al^{3+}(aq) + 3H2O(l)}$
$\ce{Al2O3 + H2SO4 -> Al2(SO4)3 + 3H2O}$ (state symbols omitted for brevity)
- behaves like an acid when it reacts with a base




# oxides

- $\ce{Al2O3}$ is amphoteric
