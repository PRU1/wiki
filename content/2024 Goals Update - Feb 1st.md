[[2024 Goals]]
- Have found that going invisible on Discord helps with focussing (alleviates some pressure to respond)
- helpful during test periods.... 

Have made little progress on my ability to focus! Got significant portions of my EE done, Chemistry IA done, English HL Essay done, TOK Essay, in short periods of time. But these were when I forced myself to do them in one sitting.
- Where I am lacking is a way to focus at whim --> i.e. during English work periods, I got little work done.
- When I am at my desk, I frequently check discord notifications
	- what has been sometimes helpful is uninstalling discord for a day and reinstalling it the next day. Helps for a bit, but the old habits re-emerge after a span of days
	- SOLUTION: do not check discord. HAHAHAHAHAHAAH very easy solution JUST DO IT.

Another issue: not getting things on my todo list done
- I tend to pack my todo list with big tasks and am unable to complete them
- I should limit myself to 2 big tasks a day, with as many subtasks as necessary. If I have more than 2 big tasks a day then I am managing time poorly
- When I sit at desk I let myself waste time for a few minutes, and lose track of time... My default activity should be to start working! Wasting time is for later.

Am not regularly cleaning desk before going to sleep: kind of lazy when I work late in the night/early morning! Sleep on time!
