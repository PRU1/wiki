## a note about making claims
the nature of a claim has to be how far away it is from the ground (the ground could be the data we are working with)
**Ground** --> everyone should agree upon it
**Analytical claim** --> straightforward, based on data trends. everyone can see it. Answers "what?"
**Interpretive claim** --> answers "so what"
**speculative claim** --> answers "why it's like that"

example: oil drop in 2020
analytical: it dropped
interpretive: it dropped because people used oil less
speculative: it dropped because people used oil less, because of (*a guess*)
# Arguments
![[Pasted image 20240910093719.png]]
- claim is broad but example is specific
- there might be a counterclaim --> I made a really bad drawing
	- so you need a qualifier (something to verify the validity) --> say it's a great pen for a "reasonable artist"
- justification connects the evidence the claim

- not measurable objectives
# DfX principles
- design for x
- define specific requirements around common goals and objectives
	- you see these in handbooks
ex. designing for reliability --> there may be a handbook for that
