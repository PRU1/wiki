to learn:
- convert each image to greyscale
- [[canny edge detection]] --> detect edges in a video
- [[hough line transform]] --> find straight lines in video data (this will be the pendulum swinging)
- calculate the length of the line in pixels and the angle it makes to the vertical 
    
- plot this data

see [phy-ia/parse.py at main · cathaypacific8747/phy-ia · GitHub](https://github.com/cathaypacific8747/phy-ia/blob/main/parse.py) for inspiration


use [matlab](https://justin-liang.com/tutorials/canny/) or python



- fix data so it's symmetrical
- get more data from (-20, 20)

Praxis stuff... move later
Why did you select the opportunity that you did
- we had the most success in thinking of possible solutions, which was one of our activities
- we all generally agreed on this idea 
How did your selection process enable you to contribute to your team
- Each of us had some weight in the final idea for decisions
- Our method, multi-something voting was effective because it was quick, and we had a lot of ideas (40+) so it helped narrow down without discussing too much
How will you enact what you realized about your role in the team in future activities
- For next time, I need to work on giving ideas that don't veer us off track (i.e. stay focussed) but a plethora of random ideas can give a decent idea
