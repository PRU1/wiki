> Lagrangian approach is simple but devoid of insight

based on the [[Principle of Least Action]]

The coordinate system is different. Instead of using vectors, lagrangian mechanics uses a [[generalized coordinate system]]


# notation
- $\dot{x}$ and $\ddot{x}$ notation used
consider the kinetic energy $E_K$ of a system of $N$ particles
$$E_{K}=\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_i^N m_{i}[\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2+\dot{z}^2]$$
$E_K$ is a function of $\{\dot{x_i},\dot{y_{i}},\dot{z_i}\}$. In one direction, say along the $x$ axis,
$$\dfrac{{\partial E_K}}{\partial\dot{x_{j}}}=m_j\dot{x}_j$$
Note that $E_K$ is a function of $\dot{x}_j$, not of time $t$. (perhaps we can deduce from $\Delta E = \int_{s_{0}}^{s_{f}}\vec{F}\cdot \rm{d}\vec{s}$ this relation holds. But $\dot{x}$ is a function of $t$ and $E_K$ is a function of $\dot{x}$, so why isn't $E_K$ a function of $t$? FIGURE OUT).
