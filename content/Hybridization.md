- explain molecular structures of compound when [[Valence Bond Theory]] was inaccurate 
- Pauling came up with it when trying to $\ce{CH4}$ bond angles
- you'd expect different bond angles+ sizes because the orbitals participating in bonding are different shapes (1 s orbital, 3 p orbitals)
	- i.e. p orbital is higher energy so shorter (and stronger) bonds
- According to experiments, the bond angles are the same (tetrahedral, 109.5 degrees)
- this suggests that the energy levels are the same shape and position (i.e. E-level) to form four of the same bonds
