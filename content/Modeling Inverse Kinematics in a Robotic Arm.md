#### Approach: "Use a fuzzy system to model the inverse kinematics in a two-joint robotic arm"

- Kinematics: describes the motion of objects 
- With a two joint arm, use kinematic equations to determine where the tip of the robotic arm will be

- Two joints: use trigonometry. 
- For more joints and a 3D input space its hard to create a math model to move the arm to desired location
- You can use fuzzy logic
