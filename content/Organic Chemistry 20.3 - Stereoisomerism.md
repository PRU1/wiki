Isomers: different compounds with the same molecular formula.

When a group of atoms are bonded in fundamentally different ways, they are called **constitutional isomers**. Examples:

# stereoisomers
## conformational stereoisomers
- rotate around $\sigma$ bond
- a type of [[isomerism]]

## cis/trans stereoisomers
- only differ by spatial orientation of atoms
- like cis vs trans isomers

		- appears in cyclic and compounds with a double bond  
## Optical isomers
- C attached to 4 different groups of atoms is called **chiral**
- optical isomerism: 
	- two compounds that have the same groups of atoms attached to a carbon, but rotate plane polarized light in opposite directions

	- non-superimposable. 
if a mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers, it is called a **racemic mixture** or racemate

you can have a molecule with multiple chiral carbons. 
- enantiomers have opposite configurations at each chiral center
- different combinations at some, but not all chiral center, is called a **diastereomer**

## Resolution -> separating entiomers
take a single enantiomer of another chiral compound and add it to a racemic mixture. the (+) and (-) components will react differently and can be separated easily
