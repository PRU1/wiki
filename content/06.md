# Requirements and Research

What are standards and codes?

## standards
- a voluntary **documented** agreement that has technical requirements or criteria that should be followed consistently
- good for consistency (i.e. language usage between manufacturers)
- created by consensus by organizations such as (ISO - international organization of standardization)
## codes
- REGULATIONS enforced by the GOVERNMENT
	- safety, performance, legal recourse for non-compliance

## research
- discovering something new
- finding sources to prove something
	- i.e. testing through experimentation

why are standards useful?
- gives you evaluation criteria
- and usually a way to test it (i.e. make sure requirement is met)

- they also have tolerances which give you acceptable value ranges

why do research ?? to make better arguments

>Three months in the lab can save you three hours in the library" Prof. Jane Philips

## secondary vs primary research
secondary: look at existing material
find processes, codes, or standards which guide your design

Research can be a way to justify a claim (especially claims which are "crazy ideas")

Standards are useful stuff that comes out of research because it tells you what you need to do to meet standards (which your stakeholders may want)
- also have verification methods --> determine if you've met a requirement or not
- also include tolerances

Use the CRAAP test

your source should be current, relevant, authorities (credible), accurate, and purposeful (should also make its biases clear)
