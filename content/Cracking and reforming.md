take a long hydrocarbon chain, and break it into two smaller chains (and usually an alkene too because not enough hydrogens)
your source of hydrocarbon chain is usually [[naphtha fraction]]

- alkenes used to make polymers

# Catalytic cracking
- take a long chain and pass it over a catalyst. add heat. this makes it break down.

## Thermal cracking
- high heat and pressure, then cool it down
- free radical mechanism and you get short chain alkanes, alkenes, and coke 
- coke is impure Carbon
## Steam cracking
- different version of thermal cracking
- chain of upto 8 C is vapourized and mixed with steam
- then BAM thermal clacking
- higher yield of ethene + short chain alkane

## Catalytic cracking
- use catalyst to reduce cracking temperature
- carbocation reaction mechanism (something like catalyst surface yoinks a H, forming a carbocation, then BOOM your carbon chain rearranges)
- produces a large portion of branched alkanes
- got to clean catalyst because C clogs surface

## Hydrocracking
- mix feedstock with hydrogen, high pressure, platinum catalyst
- Lots of branched, cyclic alkanes, and aromatics.
- no alkenes because you got hydrogens

# Reforming
- forming cyclic molecules
## Isomerization
- turn into isomers, branched alkanes
## Cyclization + aromatization
take a straight chain and turn into cyclical or aromatic

- basically lets you shift the electron density (make it spread out when you have high temp + high pressure, because you've got energy and molecules are close to each other)
