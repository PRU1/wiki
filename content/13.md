WRITE CONCISELY
- not English class

- don't record percentages for small samples

Intro structure
- initial claim, justification, honest reporting of survey
- use secondary research
	- why the opportunity matters

Four functions of an introduction
1. purpose what the report is trying to do
2. unknown  -> what's the opportunity about
3. background - what we need to get started
4. setup sort of like a thesis

try avoiding stacked setup
avoid synonyms that introduce confusion (synonyms for ideas i.e. contact area and then changing it)
stakeholders inform requirements
- government, regulatory authorities, operational environmental experts
