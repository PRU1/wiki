- find functional groups in a molecule
	- based on patterns in IR spectrum which shows bond stretching

# How it works
Molecules can bend and stretch when you blast them with IR frequency light. Different bonds between atoms vibrate at different frequencies in the IR region. If you hit a compound with a range of IR frequencies and plot the intensity of IR at each frequency after hitting the compound, you get a graph.

You can use this graph to determine what bonds are present in a compound. Different peaks in absorbances correspond to different bond absorbptions 

## First reading of Pearson TB
- why do shorter bonds vibrate at high frequency
- types of bending in molecules

### fingerprint region
region is unique for any given compound


why do H bonds have a broader shape?
![[Pasted image 20240325173825.png]]
- H bonds require more energy to bend or vibrate. So it absorbs a greater frequency of wavelengths
![[Pasted image 20240325180232.png]]
## conditions for IR absorption
- only bonds with a dipole moment that can change with time (i.e. if you stretch it, the [[dipole moment]] changes) can absorb IR
- symmetric bonds do not absorb IR
#### bending and stretching of bond
- IR can either bend or stretch bonds

## Stretches by functional groups
C=O: ~1700 cm$^{-1}$
O-H: 3650 - 3200
N-H: 3500 - 3300

difference between OH and NH: NH has sharp absorption bands of lower intensity, OH is broad

![[Pasted image 20240325210544.png]]
C=C sharp at ~1660 $cm^{-1}$
C=O at 1700 ish
C-H at 3000-2850 ish (use data booklet for IB thingies : ( )

## spectrum checklist
1. is a carbonyl group present? C=O has a strong absorption around 1700 cm$^{-1}$
2. if yes
	1. is O-H present? (broad absorption around 3000 which overlaps C-H)
	2. is N-H present? (double peaks for primary. sharp. around 3000$^+$)
	3. is C-O present? 1300-1000 strong intensity absorption<-- ester. note that C-O is smaller wave number than C=O (1700)
	4. aldehyde? two C=O absorptions near 1810 - 1760
3. if no C=O
	1. alcohol: check for OH. confirm C-O at 1300-1000 cm$^{-1}$
	2. is N-H present? (double peaks for primary, single peak for secondary. sharp. around 3000$^+$)
	3. ethers : C-O at around 1300 and no O-H near 3400
4. double bonds
	1. C=C weak absorption at around 1650
5. triple bonds
	1. C$\equiv$C around 2150 
	2. C$\equiv$N around 2250

## examples
![[Pasted image 20240325215453.png]]
C-H sp$^3$ stretch is under 3000 cm$^{-1}$. 
![[Pasted image 20240325215607.png]]
if it's spiky it's an aromatic.
for benzene:
![[Pasted image 20240325215635.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240325215738.png]]
eliminate C=O stretch. see the C=C stretch (spiky, around 1600). sp$^2$ C-H stretch at around 3200. sp$^3$ C-H stretch at around 3000. notice how the sp$^2$ is spiky.
![[Pasted image 20240325215916.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240325225751.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240325225822.png]]
C-O stretch at around 1100ish
![[Pasted image 20240325230416.png]]
look for sp$^3$ stretch followed by C-H aldehyde stretch to the right. Also look for C=O stretch (which is pointy? should not be very pointy though?)
![[Pasted image 20240325230544.png]]
higher E sp$^2$ C-H stretch (a bit above 3000, sp$^3$ C-H stretch is a bit under 3000 cm$^{-1}$)
![[Pasted image 20240325230816.png]]
for carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch and the C-H stretch "fuse", so not as round as an an alcohol
![[Pasted image 20240325231008.png]]
look for C=O stretch and spiky sp$^3$ stretch at circa 3000 cm$^{-1}$. C-O stretches in the 1300-1000s range

# IR spectroscopy of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes
## Alkanes
![[Pasted image 20240329154416.png]]
## Alkenes
1. internal stretch R-C$\equiv$C-R
	1. if non polar, then no peak at 3000+ (sp$^2$ C-H stretch) and no =C-H stretch, and may be IR inactive. No C=C peak at 1600$^+$
2. terminal stretch 
	1. sp$^2$ stretch 
	2. C=C stretch at near 1700ish
![[Pasted image 20240329161057.png]]

## Alkynes
![[Pasted image 20240329161209.png]]
1. terminal C$\equiv$C bond
	1. sharp peak at 3300ish cm$^{-1}$ --> sp C-H stretch
2. non-terminal C$\equiv$C bond
	1. no sharp peak (no H)
	2. if asymmetrical, you get a small signal for the C$\equiv$C stretch
# Q and A
### why is the IR spectra so messy?
- overtones! bunch of small vibrations. the large ones are called fundamental absorptions and be used to determine the identity of a compound
## way to calculate the bond frequency?
you can do this, albeit it is limite. 
we can derive an equation to do this! I have not attempted the derivation (just because I have a test shortly), but assume that the bond acts like a spring, and that molecules vibrate back and forth like a harmonic oscillator
$$ \bar{v} = \frac{1}{2\pi c}\sqrt{\frac{K}{\mu}} $$ where $\mu = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2}$ (related to mass of two atoms, called the *reduced mass of the system*), and $K$ is the force constant. I have no clue where $c$ comes from and what it represents. Perhaps it is the speed of light? Makes sense because $c = f\lambda$, and solve for $1/\lambda$

### why do shorter bond lengths have a faster frequency of vibration
- stronger bond so absorbs higher IR frequencies (and wavenumbers) 
- imagine the bond to be a stiff spring, less energy is expended in expanding the spring, so it vibrates faster 
### why does a primary amine have two peaks?
