during combustion, you form free radicals (O-O diradical, energy, flip spin states, becomes reactive)
radical breaks apart your hydrocarbon
- alkenes (double bonds are harder to break via free radicals (twice as many bonds to get through)
- rings are stable, so hard to break
- branches are messy (hard for oxygen to hit it because it's more circular compared to straight chain)
- alcohols are more reactive than alkanes, so they can react with free radical easier

- reaction complete when all the radicals formed are terminated
- higher branched alkanes terminate slower, are less reactive, longer time to be terminated, which decreases engine knocking.
