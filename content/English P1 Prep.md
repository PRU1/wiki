- Part of my plan to get a level 7 in English is to get a level 7 in P1 ([[IB English A Language and Literature HL LEVEL 7]])

Notes from: [IB English Paper 1 (Full Guide for 7) (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MC6b3Rg5I8)

1. First understand the text is
	1. what the goal is. Do not analyze the text first
2. Spend about 15 minutes analyzing the text and planning your essay
	1. write down the aim of teh essay at the top
	2. group the types together into 3 groups
	3. write out the three groups, write out the quotes (DO NOT WASTE TIME, short form quotes)
		1. write down a device. summarize the effect of the device
		2. everything should be on the planning paper --> you should be able to write without brain fog
	4. Practice past papers
		1. you don't want to stop to think
		2. be in the flow state
		3. important because of limited timeline (15 minutes used for planning, so only have 1 hour to write). Need to write and think at the same time
	5. Write and reflect --> get feedback!


**Components of an introduction**


**The meaning of the literary devices used (identify device and what effect it creates)**

Body paragraphs

	- talk about a literary visual or structural authorial chaices
	- accurate label of choice

	- talk about the implications! conclusions readers draw from "reading inbetween the lines"
	- transition between ideas
	- concluding sentence that relates to guiding question (LINK) and relate to thesis

## Next steps
- it appears that I can pull out stuff from the text
- I got to be more "perceptive" and references should support ideas well
- Improve quality of analysis: should be more insightful and discuss **[[how authorial choices shape meaning]]**
