[[statistical learning|Statistical Learning]] involves [[supervised learning]] and [[unsupervised learning]]

you also have semi-supervised learning, which uses a combination of labelled data and unlabelled data to make predictions.

You test how well an algorithm learns using [[mean squared error]]. Keep in mind that the more "flexible" (number of coefficients that can be tweaked) a model is, the greater the delta between [[mean squared error#Training MSE and Test MSE|testing MSE and training MSE]].
