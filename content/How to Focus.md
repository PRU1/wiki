- In order to achieve [[2024 Goals]] I got to FOCUS
- my biggest distraction right now (January 3, 2024) is Discord. 
	- keep on wanting to check it
	- but also cannot uninstall because it's useful
- Overcoming: changing app settings
- put it on do not disturb
- Ultimately, I'll have to be more disiciplined
- perhaps use a pomodoro timer technique (i.e. not open for 10 min, then 20 min, gradually increment to 2 hours or so) until I don't open it frequently
