- bonding model that explains properties of transition metals
- assumes that metal-ligand interactions are purely electrostatic
metal ion and ligand can be treated as point charges

$$E \propto \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$
- a large ion with a low charge should form few coordination compounds
- consider an octahedral [[coordination complex]]

the ligands form coordinate covalent bonds on axis (this is to keep the negative charge as far as possible from each other for stability)

now look at the d-orbitals
![[Pasted image 20240418230244.png]]
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ are on axis, the other 3 orbitals are not.
you have your ligand approaching $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals and because of electron repulsion, the $d$ orbitals split in energy level --> approached by ligand are of higher energy (because it's being pulled a part, so it takes more space and therefore energy)
