# S$\mathbf{_{N_2}}$ reactions

![[SN2 Reaction]]
- nucleophilic backside attack
- C-Br bond is polar, Bromine hogs the electrons
- makes one side partially positive and open for attack
- Leaving group: (negative) nucleophile
- available for primary halogenoalkanes (H don't block nucleophilic ATTACK)
- second order because forming transition state (which is RDS) involves nucleophile and halogenoalkane
- prefers aprotic solvent
	- protic solvents would "solvate" the nucleophile preventing it from making the attack
	- attack is important to form that transition state

# S$_{\mathbf{N_{1}}}$ Reactions
- unimolecular
- you have your nucleophile and your halogenoalkane
- C-halogen bond is polar, the halogen is hogging the electrons
- dump it into a polar solvent and supply a bit of heat
- typically a weak nucleophile (less likely to donate its electrons)
	- why a weak nucleophile?
		- something about ability to stabilize carbocation intermediates (basically make the intermediate last longer) 
		- or something about how strong electrophile they attack is strong. So it can be either weak or strong nucleophile, but you won't find weak nucleophiles undergoing SN2 reaction
