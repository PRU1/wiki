- determine relative atomic mass and molecular mass
- you have a sample of some compound
- shoot electrons at it which cause it to fragment into different ions and free radicals

(this image is [[Organic Chemistry 10.1 Notes - intro to organic chem#*heterolytic* *fission*|heterolytic fission]])
- electron beams hit at different locations, or hit a cation, to form more *cations and radicals*
these cations have different masses that deflect at different angles in a magnetic field

- adjust the strength of the magnetic field so that different masses of cations hit the detector. You want all the cations to be detected, which is why this is necessary.
## mass spectra

**vertical axis**: relative abundance. **horizontal axis**: $m/z$
Highest relative abundance (at 100): base peak

-> charge distribution and relative abundance: a positive charge distributed over a larger area is more stable, and is perhaps why longer branches tend to be more abundant

## Fragmentation patterns
you bombard a molecule with electron which transfer momentum to the molecule
molecule starts vibrate and may split apart into more fragments.
you can usually predict which fragments will be more stable (and hence more abundant)

- think about carbocation [[positive inductive effect]]
