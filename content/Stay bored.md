[[2024 Goals]]
- If you have a bunch of things that stimulate you, you'll do those things!!
- For example, if you come back from school and have a bunch of video games open or YouTube open, you'll do that instead of studying. 
- If you want to actually work and enjoy studying, you have to make it the most stimulating activity
- You do this by being bored! If you have nothing to do (no stimulating activities), then studying will be the default activity (since it is the only activity that is interesting, everything else is boring!)

- List out the activities in your life
- And rank them by priority.
- Make the highest priority activity the most stimulating activity!
