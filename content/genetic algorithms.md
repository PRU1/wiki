- an optimization theory based on evolution 
genetic algorithm selects "better" individuals from a current population and uses them as parents for the next generation. As you repeat this process, each successive generation is better suited to solve a problem (hence is optimized).

great for problems you cannot solve using standard optimization (i.e. non-stochastic processes, nondifferentiable model functions, or something non-linear)

randomly create mutations because it might create a better child

# project 
[[portfolio optimization]] is a non-linear problem. you can try using a genetic algorithm to optimize a portfolio.
