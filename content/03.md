# Professionalism
- series of habits to start developing and practicing
	- be a good team player. stay on task. deal with unexpected obstacles. maintain a good attendance.
# models in Praxis
1. FDRC
2. Pterry model
3. Toulin's model for argument
4. Hoover dam model

Generally, the models include

1. what is the problem or opportunity --> **need** --> *why*
2. what must be done to meet the need? --> **goal** --> *what*
3. what are the expectations of the solution --> **objective** --> *how*[^1]
4. 

called **NGOs**: must be negotiated and agreed upon by all parties *informed by stakeholders*

- they should be 'traceable' (i.e. you can link the needs to the goals to the objectives)
example
	Need: reduce hospital wait times
	Goal: reduce wait times by 20% in the first year
	Objective: increase staff so that patients are registered within 5 min of arriving
		- captures the intent of a design
note that it becomes more specific

NGOs have *requirements* and *evaluation criteria*
*requirements* : specific, verifiable, necessary

**selection-style design**: choose the best from pre-existing solutions

## objectives
a good objective should describe *what it should do or be*. --> you should be able to measure it

example objectives: creating a backpack --> should have a characteristic and unit
i.e. 
should have a laptop compartment that fits a 15in standard laptop
price should be <$100
dimensions of backpack --> should be about x by y by z m
weight of backpack should be < 2 kg
material strength -> tensile strength about 100 N/m^2
shoulder pads -> can't put more than __ pressure on your shoulders
adjustable straps -> fits people sized __ to __

[^1]: does not necessarily mean what the solution is


## converging criteria
1. does it meet key metrics --> take measurements
2. is it viable --> informed by requirements
3. how does it compare to others --> evaluation criteria
