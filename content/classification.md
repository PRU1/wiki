[[Machine learning]] involves linear classifers, 
most useful setting of ML is [[supervised learning]]

classification problems are a kind of supervised learning, because we have a desired output for input test data

classification problem: binary output is called binary; otherwise called *multi-class*
goal of classification problem; if given some new input value $x^{(n+1)}$, predict the value of $y^{(n+1)}$

Regression: ![[Regression]] is similar to classification
