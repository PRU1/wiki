Why do you want to join aUToronto? (300 word limit)

- I want to join aUToronto because it is cool
- Fresh out of high school looking to extend club experiences to something impactful
- NRGHacks!!
- Working with a bunch of different is really what pulled the event off
- I really don’t know much → want to learn
- Know machine learning stuff yippie → like to learn

- just picked up driving
- fan of my own autonomy (not having to trouble my parents or take transit)
- it gets boring and there are unpredictable drivers


I want to join aUToronto to help design the next generation of personal transport. For context, I got my G2 two weeks ago and am already bored of driving alone. I don't get the thrill of racing (it is unfortunately unsafe), nor the satisfaction of being productive. While public transit is available for me to work during a commute, public transit is not as convenient.  This led to my interest in aUToronto, amongst other UofT design teams, to design autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars enable us to be both safer and more productive. 

I believe I can be an asset to aUToronto because of my curiosity and desire to leave an impact in my community. This is perhaps best shown through my judging a hackathon, where our coding club prepared for and hosted a 100+ person hackathon in roughly 2 months. I had pretty much no leadership experience prior to this, but I learned along the way and people enjoyed the hackathon! In terms of my technical skills, I use C++ for competitive programming, am proficient in LaTeX, and am learning ML theory. My technical skills are not that impressive, but I can learn what I need to for aUToronto in the coming months.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my application!


I just started driving and have seen enough reckless drivers to be convinced that autonomous transport is safer. Autonomous transportation is the future, and I want to help develop it.

aUToronto is the perfect place to contribute to autonomous transportation. Admittedly, as a first-year student my skills are minimal, but my curiosity and quick learning make up for it. Currently, I am teaching myself statistical learning techniques (i.e. ML, GA). I have written neural networks in Python with PyTorch, as well as from the ground up (using only numpy, in an attempt to understand NN theory better). My other technical skills include programming competitively with C++, typesetting with LaTeX, and CAD in AutoDesk Inventor. My leadership and team skills are also an asset to the team, best shown in my involvement as an event organizer for a 100+ person hackathon (more details in resume).

I'm still a shy person who has a lot to learn, but I believe I can make a meaningful contribution in progressing autonomous vehicles with the mentoring and community aUToronto provides.

Thank you for considering my application, and I hope to hear back from you soon!

Thank you
