One of my [[2024 Goals]] is to get more done. I need to be able to CONCENTRATE. YIPPIEEEEEEEEEEEE

Main points from a video I watched
- Takes about 15-20 minutes to get into a flow state (as you practice, it is quicker to get into a flow state)
- Any distraction (i.e. phone notification) takes you out of a flow state, and you need to restart
- so I CANNOT get distracted
	- should probably avoid listening to music (especially with vocals) when trying to accomplish considerable amounts of work

Solution: pretend I am already in a flow state
- yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
- related to neural linguistic programming I suppose
