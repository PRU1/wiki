## How to produce a first-class paper that will get published,  
stand out from the crowd and pull in plenty of readers  

  

1. keep your message clear (avoid misinterpretations)
    1. put additional data in supplementary material
2. Have a strong discussion section - people want to know you’ve read other people’s research and understand existing literature
3. Answer the question: what did you do? Every paragraph should support this

> In science, ‘What’s new and  
> compelling?’ is the red thread. It’s the whole  
> reason for writing the paper. Then, once that’s  
> established, the paragraphs that follow become  
> the units of logic that comprise the red thread  

1. Don’t write so you don’t get red-flagged by a journal. Write so it makes sense (helpful especially for a more general audience)

“Though not inclusive, this paper provides a useful review of the well-known methods of physical oceanography using as examples various research that illustrates the methodological challenges that give rise to successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in oceanographic research.”

Instead, write “We review methods of oceanographic research with examples that reveal specific challenges and solutions”

1. Don’t write like a zombie
    1. scientific writing doesn’t have to be dry. It can be a little creative, but make sure you’re still concise and get the point across (creative writing doesn’t mean you’re writing an English paper)
2. Get the structure write (you’re paper is hopeless without the correct structure)

> I won’t know why I should care  
> about your experiment until you tell me why  
> I should
