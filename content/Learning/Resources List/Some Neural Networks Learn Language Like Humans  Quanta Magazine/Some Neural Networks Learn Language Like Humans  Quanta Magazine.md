- ANNs mimic the human brain but we don’t know if they process inputs the same way
- So we don’t actually know if ANNs process information the same way humans do
- When it comes to learning language natural and artificial networks seem to learn similarly
- Even general ANNs (meaning they haven’t been fine tuned for a specific application) seem to mimic the human brain

- Used a GAN neural network (generative adversarial network)
- Made up of two neural networks
    - discriminator and generator

> “Just as research has shown that feedback from caregivers shapes infant productions of sounds, feedback from the discriminator network shapes the sound productions of the generator network,” said Kapatsinski,

- suggests that the human brain is not hardwired to learning language, which is what Noam Chomsky proposed in the 1950s
