- Don’t do generic reflections
- Do weekly practice

1) Keep a journal

2) Set an hour aside each week to review the journal

3) Don’t reread the journal entries

Article was interesting but I’d like to try an improvised version of this (too much structure to this for me, but then again I’d have to try it).

- give time to think (no phones). If I wasn’t that productive, make a tweak and try again tomorrow. Rinse and repeat until I can focus
