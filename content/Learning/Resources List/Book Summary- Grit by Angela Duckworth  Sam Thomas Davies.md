- Secret to outstanding achievement is grit (passion + persistence for long term goals)
- You should be able to maintain determination and motivation for long periods of time
- Grit is about having a high level goal for a long time (until it’s completed)
- Grit people have four traits: interest, practice, purpose, and hope
    - they do more deliberate practice
- There’s a hidden bias - people think that people who achieve mastery in something arrive there because they are naturally talented
- Talent can help though - talent is how fast we improve that skill. But effort makes skill and effort makes skill productive

> Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you’re willing to stay loyal to it. It’s not about falling in love; it’s about _staying_ in love.

- Grit people tend not to say “ “I’m bored.” “The effort isn’t worth it.” “This isn’t important to me.” “I can’t do this, so I might as well give up.” “

## How experts practice

- Set a stretch goal (i.e. something they can’t do just yet, in order to improve a weakness)
- Strive to achieve this goal with undivided attention
- As soon as possible get feedback
- Repeat until goal is reached

  

- Deliberate practice has 4 rudiments
    - A clearly defined stretch goal
    - Full concentration and effort
    - Immediate and informative feedback
    - Repetition with reflection and refinement
