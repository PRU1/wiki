Take aways:

- Avoid small talk (i.e. hello, how are you)
- Find common ground (i.e. something you both enjoy). Makes it easier to talk
- Make eye contact (need to work on this)
- Ask a personal question and their opinion for something
- Tell them something nice, but it has to be honest (i.e. not something they’ve heard a hundred times)
- Remember the details of the conversation (i.e. their name, place of conversation, pet name, etc.). This way the next time you meet them you’ll remember them.
