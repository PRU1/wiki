Abstract

The attempts by the neuroscientists, computer scientists and physicists to capture the computational architecture and processes of the human brain and their implementation in silicon devices are now giving encouraging results. The studies of model neural networks and their properties are now at a very exciting stage. We start with a brief introduction of the developments made in neural network modelling. The current research activities in this field in India (to the best of author's knowledge) are then discussed and some suggestions regarding the future course of action indicated.
