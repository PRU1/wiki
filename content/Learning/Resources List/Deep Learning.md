## An MIT Press book

### Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville

The Deep Learning textbook is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. The online version of the book is now complete and will remain available online for free.

The deep learning textbook can now be ordered on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472485235&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+learning+book).

## FAQ

- Can I get a PDF of this book?
    
    No, our contract with MIT Press forbids distribution of too easily copied electronic formats of the book.
    
- Why are you using HTML format for the web version of the book?
    
    This format is a sort of weak DRM required by our contract with MIT Press. It's intended to discourage unauthorized copying/editing of the book.
    
- What is the best way to print the HTML format?
    
    Printing seems to work best printing directly from the browser, using Chrome. Other browsers do not work as well.
    
- Can I translate the book into Chinese?
