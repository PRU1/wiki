Appendix: Is there a simple algorithm for intelligence?

- Hope for machine learning is that they will extend past simple pattern recgonizition programs

How the author defines intelligence: “Is there a simple algorithm which can ‘think’ along essentially the same lines as the human brain?”

- Maybe there isn’t a simple algorithm, but it’s made up of many “irreducible” components (see paragraph starting with “contrariwise, and despite these optimistic examples…”

  

# is there a simple algorithm for intelligence?

  

- we can start by asking a somewhat related question
- is there a simple explanation for how the human brain works?
- start by quantifying the complexity of the brain
- Connectomics
    - raw wiring “how many neurons there are in the brain, how many glial cells, and how many connection there are between the neurons”
    - billions of glial cells, and trillions of connections between neurons
    - not very simple….
- Another way: look at brain from perspective of molecular biology
    - “how much genetic information is needed to describe the brain’s architecture”
    - Humans are 96% chimpanzees

- evidence that there is a simple algorithm for intelligence
    - experiment reported in April 2000
    - rewired brains of newborn ferrets
    - signal from ferret’s eyes is transmitted to the visual cortex
    - scientists in this study rerouted the signal so it went to the auditory cortex instead (part of brain usually used for hearing)
- how does the visual cortex work?
- visual cortex contains orientation columns

  

- slabs of neuron which respond to light coming in a particular direction (a orientation column activations depending on which direction light is incident)
- the ferrets were able to “see” even though their eyes were rewired to the auditory canal
- that’s so mean : (
- this implies that different parts of the brain learn to respond to sensory data in the same way
- so maybe there is a simple irreducible way to write an algorithm for intelligence?

> What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle.
