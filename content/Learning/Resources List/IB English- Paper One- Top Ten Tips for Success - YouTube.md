Paper One Tips for IB Literature AND Language and Literature

We get it. You’re busy and didn’t have time to watch all the Paper One videos, and you’re  
looking for a quick and easy document to give you some points. No worries, Dave and  
Andrew are here! We’ve examined thousands upon thousands of papers, and we’d like to  
share some of our favorite tips for students. Keep these in mind while you are preparing  
and writing your Paper One. Understanding and internalizing these ideas will surely make  
a difference in your performance!  

10 Tips for the Paper One

1. Read and annotate carefully.  
    ○ Remember, this is a reading test first. Take your time, use the margins to  
    write down big ideas, and pay attention to authorial choices. Students who  
    read and annotate carefully will almost always score better than those who  
    do not.  
    
2. Focus on the question.  
    ○ Don’t ignore that guiding question; it’s there for a reason! Read that  
    question carefully and identify “keywords” that should appear in your thesis  
    statement and topic sentences. You may want to use synonyms for these  
    keywords from time to time to prevent redundancy in your paper.  
    
3. Make an outline or plan.  
    ○ This is critical! Take a few extra minutes and create a rudimentary outline to  
    guide your writing. This isn’t the time to be detailed and thorough, but  
    capturing paragraph topics and briefly outlining your paper BEFORE writing  
    will keep you focused and on track during your race to the finish.  
    
4. Understand and articulate the message ofthe text.  
    ○ Summary alert! Do not summarize what the author has said. Instead,  
    consider the main message of the text, the purpose, and the implications.  
    Look for nuances and details and explore the main claim the author is trying  
    to make.  
    
5. Discuss the author’s choices. (Know your technicalterms!)  
    ○ This is NOT the time to skimp on authorial choices! Dave and Andrew have  
    provided several handouts on a range of topics. Know those terms, be able  
    to identify them in a range of text types, and be sure to explain how authors  
    use those choices to shape meaning.  
    
6. Connect author’s choices directly to the effect on the reader and/or message of  
    the text.  
    ○ Remember that all texts have a precise target audience and have been  
    intentionally crafted and created to convey a precise message to that  
    audience. So, when writing, discuss the impact of authorial choices on the  
    reader or audience.  
    
7. Explore implications and subtleties.  
    ○ Go beyond the obvious! Consider what most students will identify in the  
    text and the “common” arguments writers are likely to make. Once you have  
    those, keep on thinking! Learn how to read “between the lines” and identify  
    nuances. What is the author indirectly suggesting or implying (but not overtly  
    saying) in the text?  
    
8. Write clear focused paragraphs with topic sentences that use wording ofthe GQ  
    and aim for more than a 5 paragraph response if you can.  
    ○ The 5-paragraph essay has a time and place, but it is unlikely to get students  
    into the higher mark bands. For those elusive high scores, quantity counts.  
    Write as many focused body paragraphs as you can that explore a range of  
    rich ideas linked to the Guiding Question.  
    
9. Maintain academic language and register, be precise, but don’t be afraid to be  
    yourself and have some voice.  
    ○ Yes, this is textual analysis, but it doesn't have to be boring and devoid of  
    voice. Pay attention to your word choice, and showcase your best academic  
    language. However, be human. Try starting with a (short) engaging hook,  
    pepper some voice in the body paragraphs, and insert some personality in  
    the conclusion. It just might make your paper stand out!  
    

10.Breathe and Relax.  
○ Hey, we know you’re nervous. However, it’s important to breathe, relax, and  
stay centered. Research has shown time and time again that students do  
not perform well when they are highly anxious. So, use a calming routine  
that works for you prior to the exam. Maintain perspective during the  
assessment. This isn’t life or death. You’ve got this!
