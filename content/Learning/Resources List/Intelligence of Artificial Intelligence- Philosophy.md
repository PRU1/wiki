- is AI a duplication of human intelligence?

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field devoted to building artificial animals (or at least artificial  
> creatures that – in suitable contexts – appear to be animals) and, for many, artificial persons  
> (or at least artificial creatures that – in suitable contexts – appear to be persons)  

- goal of AI : think and act like humans??? suspicious paper

the paper argues that machines are incapable of having conscious intelligence

but makes no distinction between consciousness and intelligence

what is conscious intelligence?

what is intelligence?

Not impressed by this paper…

Argument I: Computers and machines do not have the ability to doubt their existence. Therefore, they do not have a conscious mind ←- this is arguing SOMETHING ELSE, consciousness mind =/= conscious intelligence

Argument II: Chinese room argument

Argument III:

Argument IV: the trolley dilemna. Basically says AI lacks morals to make an “on-the-spot rational decision”. “high chances” that a driverless car will “make an unlikely decision with rigorous consequences”. ughhhhhh
