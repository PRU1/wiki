- Assign a cost function to tell your neural network how bad it is
    
    - cost is small when network is accurate

- Question is: how to change bias and weights to minimize the cost function?
- use backpropagation to change weights and biases.
- Optimization problem

## Gradient Descent

- Start at any point on a function
- step right/left depending on which side of the function has a smaller value
    - you’ll approach local minimum of functions
- Or just see where the slope becomes closer and closer to 0
