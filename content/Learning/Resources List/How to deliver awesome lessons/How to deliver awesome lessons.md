### Researching lesson content

- collect, consider, select, arrange, master
    - consider: determines what is relevant
    - arrange: must be presented logically
    - master: lesson plan! or in my case slide shows for coding club
- Introduction: what you will be able to do by the end of the lesson
    
    - why what you are learning is important

    INTEREST: instructor has to keep everyone interested, otherwise people won’t listen
    
    Participation: you’re more likely to learn if you are “mentally and physically involved” in learning
    
    Accomplishment: must feel they accomplished something by the end of the lesson
