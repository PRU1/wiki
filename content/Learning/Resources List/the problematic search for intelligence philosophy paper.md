- people don’t have a good definition of intelligence
- psychologists have working definitions of intelligence that works for the time being
- 1904 Spearman “advances the definition that intelligence is the tendency of all human abilities to be positively correlated”.
    - if someone is good at one thing, they tend to be good at other things
- L Gottfredson + 52 collaborators in a field, say “a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience”
- “. Anatasi, avers that “Intelligence is not a single, unitary ability, but rather a composite of several functions” (Anatasi, 1992:610). ← intelligence is the mix of abilities that we need to survive and advance as a culture
- “J. Person conceives intelligence as “a biological mechanism by which the effect of a complexity of stimuli are brought together and given a somewhat unified effect in behaviour” (quoted in Legg and Hutter, 2007:5).”
- Weschler “aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully, to think rationally and to deal effectively with the environment” (Weschsler, 1975:135)
- “intelligence is popularly defined as the ability to learn, understand and deal with novel situations” (Kline, 1991:1)
- “Human intelligence is the scope of all types of human thinking. That is, we shall include into intellectual human activity not only rational thinking, but also emotional thinking, unconscious thinking, intuitive thinking, and automatic control of biological system” (Antonov, 2011:164)
- D.W. Pyle: “the short answer to the question ‘What is intelligence?’ is that we are just not sure!” (Pyle, 1979:1). Pyle argues that intelligence is situation specific. Takes on various meanings depending on the context

To a large extent, the orientation or perspective adopted by a researcher or  
writer determines the notion of intelligence he or she adopts. Thus, the biologist  
would stress the ability to adapt to the demands of the environment; the  
educationalist the ability to learn; some psychologists emphasise the  
measurement of the ability to reason and other cognitive functions; others the  
development of these functions; and probably the layman would mumble  
something about commonsense’ (Pyle, 3)  

- intelligence to Pyle is a way of behaving + acting, not something people have

  

## theories of intelligence

- Louis Thurstone multiple factors theory
    - there’s something called the “g” factor which aims to measure intelligence as
        1. verbal comprehension
        2. verbal fluency
        3. numeracy or arithmetical ability
        4. memory
        5. perceptual speed
        6. inductive reasoning
        7. spatial visualization
