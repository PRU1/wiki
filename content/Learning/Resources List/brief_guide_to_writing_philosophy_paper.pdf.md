- Philosophers are motivated by the big questions
    - “What is truth” etc
- Philosophy is not an opinion dump
- There is a method

1. Attain clarity of exact question being asked
2. Providing answers which are logically structured

  

### The Ideal Philosophical Argument

- Use undeniable logic to come to an unobvious conclusion
- Positive argument: supports a claim. Negative argument: refutes a claim

  

You need to have a thesis: a claim that may be true or false

### Structural Requirements

1. Form a precise thesis
    1. get to the point quickly
2. Define technical or ambiguous terms in thesis or argument
    1. Make it clear what you are talking about
3. Motivate your thesis
    1. why the audience should care
4. “Explain briefly how you will argue in favour of your thesis”

> Take care to clearly indicate when you are speaking in your own voice, and when you are explicating someone else’s argument or point of view but not yourself advocating it

1. Explain what you are critiquing (I don’t think I need this for my EE)

  

THERE’S MORE TO THIS ARTICLE, but I stopped reading it (got bored)

- mostly about conventions in philosophy
