1. Wake up 15-30 minutes earlier every day (nothing drastic)
    1. Hmmm. I probably won’t do that
2. Sleep earlier
3. Put alarm clock far from bed
4. Get out of bedroom as soon as alarm is shut off
5. Don’t rationalize (i.e. tell yourself to sleep just 5 more minutes)
6. Let yourself sleep in sometimes (maybe once a week)
7. Have a reward
8. Have something to do with the extra time (don’t waste it! Otherwise what’s the point)
