Can machines think?

- definition of machine and “think” are wishy washy
    - comes down to how most people define them
- Turing proposes a new form of the problem called the “Imitation Game”

> It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an  
> interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the  
> other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other  
> two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the  
> end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A." The  
> interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:

- is this new question worthwhile investigating?
    - yes because you do not penalize machine/person based on their personal traits
- Turing proposed only digital computers should be allowed to compete in this game
- what are digital computers?
    - can carry out any operations done by human computers
    - consists of
        - store (memory storage)
        - executive unit (where operations happen)
        - control (make sure all rules are followed (i.e. calculation rules))
- only finite amount of memory can be used at a time (”no theoretical difficulty in the idea of a computer with unlimited store. Of course only a finite part can have been used at any one time”)
- Babbage’s analytical machine was entirely mechanical therefore slow
- modern digital computers are electrical —> just like the nervous system!
- computers are discrete state systems —> the difference between two states is different enough that we can ignore intermediate states (i.e. inbetween on/off for a light switch

### Turing’s theological objection

- theological argument.: “Thinking is a function of man’s immortal soul. God has given an immortal soul to every man and woman, but not to any other animals or to machines. Hence no animals or machine can think”
    - going to skip this part in research because don’t think it’s an important argument to bring up

## Turing’s rebuttal to the mathematical objection

i.e. Godels theorem (got to google this)

come back to Godel’s theorem

  

## The argument from consciousness

“not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thought and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain-that is, not only write it but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure, grief when its values fuse, be warmed by flattery be made miserable by its mistakes………….” Prof Jefferson in his Lister Oration for 1949.

  

Good quote to think about integrating somehow: “I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mystery necessarily be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned with in this paper”

  

Types of mistakes

- errors of function
    - mechanical or electrical fault
    - abstract machines don’t make these mistakes (not mechanical or electrical) (or rather they are ficticious)
- errors of conclusion

## Argument of continuity in the nervous system

- nerve pulses are continuous
- discrete state systems cannot mimic this

  

## Why are humans not machines?

- “if each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But there are no such rules, so men cannot be machines”
    
    - is machine learning a machine then? it’s based off stochastic processes
