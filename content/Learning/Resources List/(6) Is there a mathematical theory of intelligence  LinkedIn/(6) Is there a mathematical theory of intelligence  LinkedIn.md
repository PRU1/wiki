“Anything in the physical or biological world is subject to analysis by mathematical models if it can be described in terms of mathematical expressions, concepts and language.”

  

- intelligence has been reduced to sorts of optimization algorithms, problem solving methods or neural networks
- natural intelligence (biological, human, animal intelligence)
- artificial intelligence —> ML, cognitive intelligence, alien intelligence
- general/universal intelligence: transcends human intelligence

## natural intelligence

mimics how animals organize their life, evolution!, how the grain works

NIOAs - nature inspired optimization algorithms

i.e. swarm intelligence
