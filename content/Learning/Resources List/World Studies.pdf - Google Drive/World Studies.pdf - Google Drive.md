**area of study: science, technology, society**

In the EE, got to include

1. issue of global importance
    1. misinformation on the state of AI
2. identify a local manifestation of the issue of global importance
3. develop a clear rationale for taking an interdisciplinary approach and use the conceptual framework and vocabulary of two Diploma Programme subjects.

  

my RQ: to what extent can mathematical models simulate human intelligence?

  

other EE stuff

- philosophy essays must construct “a personal philosophical argument”

![[Untitled.png]]

- got to develop local and global context —> i.e. why is worrying about sentient AI important? why is developing intelligent AI important?
- don’t make a narrative. you want to argue your own point
- should have longer than usual intros to justify selection of subjects
- to be complete: explanation of what subjects have been used, why they have been chosen, how they will be used and why a world studies approach was needed
- must name a local case study/focus
- how to score in criterion C: critical thinking: requires higher order thinking: discussion and evaluation, not just description and narration
- look at syllabus guide
- conclusion: show results of integration of two subjects and come to a unique outcome
- have an evaluative section towards the end and reflect on the “integrative approach and the reliability of the sources used”
- clearly explain math work as to show understanding
- diagrams are helpful
- abstract: insert RQ, conclusion, stay within 300 words

  

**criterion A: focus and method**

- specific and sharply focussed RQ
- stated clearly in introduction. formulated as a question not a statement
- identify an issue/topic of global significance, examine it through one or more local manifestations
- establish significance of global issue in introduction

**criterion B: knowledge and understanding**

- knowledge has clear basis in two areas of subject
- should be familiar with terminology and usage of subject. Place issue in academic context, and indicate limitations of individual subjects
- should understand conceptual framework of both subjects
- terminology and concepts should be relevant to the issue and subjects under study. Define ambiguous or contested terms. “The essay should be acceptable to audiences from the different subjects being integrated”

**criterion C: critical thinking**

- research should the same level of integrity as with individual subjects. Must be relevant to RQ.
- discuss limitations of research material
- should not be straightforward descriptive or narrative account
- should have an integrative argument or explanation - different subjects should be coherently brought together to address the question through (i.e.)
    - a complex casual explanation
    - a leading metaphor
    - a model
    - an analogy
- should evaluate on success of integrative approach to issue.

**criterion D: presentation**

- use common sense and make it look professional

**criterion E: engagement**

- reflection in RPPF
- show examiner student thinking, creativity, originality within the research process. Student voice must be present and show learning that has taken place.

  

  

problem right now: keep on getting distracted while working

why that’s an issue: slows me down, can’t learn as fast

how to focus better: pick a point and stare at it for 30-60 sec without thinking

gap effects: when you notice you are slowing down, take a 10 sec break

- sit down and do nothing; let your mind wander
