logistic regression: optimizing squiggle

t-cluster - group things into clusters

gradient descent does all the above

  

- pick a random value for gr to improve on
- sum of square residuals —> a loss function
- sum up the squared residuals
- you want to minimize the squared residual

GR does a few data points far away from the optimal point

as it gets closer to the optimal value, it decreases the step size. this way you don’t over/undershoot the global minimum

- use gradient descent when it is not possible to set the derivative = 0
- size of step should be related to the slope
