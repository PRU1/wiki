# Framing
What is framing
- defining an engineering opportunity
- all the information someone would need


Modelling: the world as we see it, it's a perception (what in the yap)

How do people understand things?
1. participant observation --> b/c engineering deals with people
2. naturalistic observation
3. qualitative research (something that doesn't have definite answer)
we are trying to see things (people or understanding) and put them inside some framework how we understand what needs to be done

# another model : ( PAAI
Perceive, Assess, Act, Interpret
Forms a cycle:

Perceiving(feel, touch) --> interpret (explore meanings behind things, what a piece of evidence means, explore models (teamwork)) --> assess (check understanding, determine the 'best' interpretation) --> Act 

What is a value?
- deeply held belief, how you thing the world should act

Underlying goals of Praxis: understand and enhance your self-awareness, increase your intentionality
you should be able to take other perspectives

-> lets you figure out what you are missing
- you should check your interpretations with others and figure out what you are missing

Perceptions -> what you see/hear/smell

# Scoping
- defines the boundaries of what is consideration
- this gives focus, and makes your task more manageable

Perspective answers: "How am I looking at this?"
Scoping answers: "What am I considering"
