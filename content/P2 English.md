**What made this paper great (28/30)**
- establishes theme in first sentence, as a hook (although it may be more beneficial to skip a hook and introduce both texts first?)
- establishes comparison - environments moods set by author impact readers heart (extent: stay with them for years)
- missing year of publication
- Comparison: the how (i.e. devices used). Contrast: the why (the significance of the devices)
