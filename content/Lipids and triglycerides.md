[[All things Chemistry]]
### lipids
- organic molecule, such as fats or oils
- can store energy.
- made up of repeating units called fatty acids
fatty acids: $\ce{CH3(CH2)_{n}COOH}$ (carboxylic acids)

can be classified into **saturated fatty acids** and **unsaturated fatty acids**
## saturated fatty acids
- bonded to as many $\ce{H}$ as possible
- form long straight chains that can be packed together (big LDF, solid at room temperature)
- animals use saturated fatty acids to store energy
## unsaturated fatty acids
- has double bonds
- because of these bonds, the structures are not regular and cannot be packed as tightly
- liquids at room temperature. animals use unsaturated fatty acids to store energy
