I struggle to be disciplined (i.e. start a task and finish).

Here's a list of things I am trying to be more disciplined


# Yay! techniques
1. Todo list (MAX 2 big things a day, with as many subtasks as required)
	1. more than 2 and I'm not getting past the first item
2. No Discord desktop while working.

# Failed techniques
1. Time blocking
	- does not work. too restrictive
