- proton donor (Bronsted-Lowry)
- electron pair acceptor (Lewis)

# Strength of acid
- a strong acid donates its $\ce{H+}$ easily
- it donates the $\ce{H+}$ if it is energetically favourable
- it's energetically favourable if the negative charge can be stabilized
	- usually resonance structures are more stable than compounds without resonant structures
	- think of it like the electrons can move to distribute the charge.
### acidity constant 
Take an acid and dissolve it in water
$$\ce{HA + H2O <=> H3O+ + A-}$$
the acid dissociation constant (measures how much the acid will dissolve)
$$ K_{a}= \frac{\ce{[H3O+][A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}}$$
- a strong acid loses its $\ce{H+}$ easily, which means the conjugate base holds on to the $\ce{H+}$ weakly, so is a weak base (remember a strong [[Bases|base]] grabs the $\ce{H+}$ easily).
