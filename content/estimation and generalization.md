- making [[Machine learning]] algorithms is not as easy as it seems!
- we got to get data
- get a space for possible solutions
- characterize what makes a good solution
- find an algorithm that finds a good solution
- run the algorithm
- validate the result
	- the way you evaluate the result is with [[Evaluation criteria]]
