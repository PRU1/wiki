Time to lock in 

![[Pasted image 20240921215410.png]]

- time to stop being mediocre and push through boring work
	- get fast at math and physics again
		- I'll probably end up getting much faster 
- sleep enough
- perhaps even physical activity
- UTMIST and/or aUToronto
- get a 4.0 GPA (grade isn't that important, but it should be a habit to excel in everything I do. It's a useful life skill)
