- tell you the number of chemical environments
- help to determine structure of organic compound
- non destructive, needs large amounts of sample (why?)

certain isotopes of molecules have [[nuclear spin]]. in the presence of a magnetic field, it will align itself with the field 

if you shoot radio waves at the sample in the magnetic field, there will be a frequency where protons will flip flop orientations (resonance! it will resonate)

this frequency of radio wave is absorbed and detected by the H NMR machine
- hydrogen bond means lone hydrogen which can go boom with radio wave (aka flip flop)
- 1/2 spin state
- easiest with H

## electron shielding
- electrons can crowd around a H
- this interferes with its magnetic moment, making it weaker

## the TMS
tetramethlysilane -> very few molecules will have more shielded H
set as the highest possible value. All values appear relative to it.
need to set a reference because experimental setups use different RF frequencies and magnetic field strengths

## interpreting the spectra
- height of spikes is related to the number of H
	- because if you have more H, think of the spikes "superimposing"
- note that the choice of solvent can shift the H NMR spectra
