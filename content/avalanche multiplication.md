- happens with insulating and semiconductors ![[Pasted image 20240623213119.png]]
once you have some electron flow (i.e. higher energy electrons knocking off electrons in an insulator), the effect is multiplicative --> becomes easier and easier to knock off more electrons

this is how "large portions of a normally-insulating crystal can begin to conduct" ~ [wikipedia]([Avalanche breakdown - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_breakdown)).
