Write questions about 
1. refining, reframing, rescoping
2. process
3. concepts
4. next steps

Let's do 2. Process 
- what creativity techniques did you use to brainstorm
- how did you build the prototype (i.e. was it individual)
- why did you choose to do _something_ while designing
next steps:
- what problems with your scale down prototype would you need to address in a full scale?
- can you give a cost estimate
- how can you manufacture this on a large scale
- which prototype do you think is most feasible
