in [[All things Chemistry|chemistry]], you got to form [[Acids|acids]] yippie!

# formation of sulphur acids
note that $\ce{SO3}$ and $\ce{SO2}$ are gases.
## formation of sulphurous acid
$$\begin{align}
\ce{S + O2 &-> SO2}  \\
\ce{SO2 + H2O &-> H2SO3}
\end{align} $$
## formation of sulphuric acid
$$\begin{align}
\ce{S + \frac{3}{2}O2 &-> SO3}  \\
\ce{SO3 + H2O &-> H2SO4}
\end{align} $$
# formation of nitrogen acids
## formation of nitrogen oxides
### way 1: from cars 
- high heat + pressure of engine causes $\ce{N2}$ and $\ce{O2}$ to bond
- $\ce{N2 + O2 -> NO}$
 and 
 - $\ce{N2 + 2O2 -> 2NO2}$
 you can also form $\ce{NO2}$ from $\ce{NO}$: $\ce{2NO + O2 -> 2NO2}$
 - dissolve $\ce{NO2}$ in water and it forms $\ce{HNO3}$ and $\ce{HNO2}$. 
 - dissolve in oxygenated water ($\ce{O2 + H2O}$) and you favour the production of $\ce{HNO3}$
### way 2: a different reaction mechanism
- leads to acid rain

- there are free radicals in the atmosphere that react with $\ce{NO2}$ and $\ce{NO}$ to form nitrous and nitric acid

# effects of acid deposition
### on limestone
marble and limestones are made from calcium carbonate $\ce{CaCO3}$
- sulphur dioxide reacts with $\ce{CaCO3}$: $\ce{2CaCO3 + 2SO2 -> 2CaSO4 + 2CO2}$ 
- sulphuric acid reacts with $\ce{CaCO3}$: $\ce{CaCO3 + H2SO4 -> CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O}$
- calcium sulphate washes off the limestone or flakes off
- something similar happens with nitric acid
### rusting
- can speed up corrosion. reacts with metal to form a salt, which increase conductivity, and increases redox reaction that causes rusting
### plant life
- slow plant growth, injury or death
- causes minerals in soil (i.e. $\ce{Mg^{2+}, K+, etc}$) to wash away before being absorbed by plants (called **leaching**) 
### water
- changes pH, fish can't survive.
- increases solubility of aluminium, which interferes with fish's gills ability to take in oxygen

# how to reduce acid deposition
## reduce production of $\ce{SO2}$
- hydrodesulfurization -> removes sulphur from petroleum -> forms $\ce{H2S}$
- wet slurry of $\ce{CaO and CaCO3}$ reacts with $\ce{SO2}$ to form $\ce{CaSO4}$
# reduce production of $\ce{NO_X}$
- catalytic converters --> reverse toxic emissions
- reduce temperature --> shift equilibrium to favour reactants
