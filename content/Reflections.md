How did you approach your team's design process? 

What are good things 
- we got comfortable with each other quick
- we first broke first to brainstorm
- once we got a workable idea, we stayed with it to the end (avoid wasted time redesigning when it wasn't necessary)
- made changes on the way to make the final design work
- tested our design with a bottle at every step of the build
- improvisation --> to reduce material count

What could we have done better
- aesthetics --> it doesn't look very nice. if we spent more time designing beforehand it may have been better

Merits and drawback of planning and design
-  helps figure out sources of error to save time when building
- makes sure you meet design requirements

How did today's activities impact your understanding of engineering design?
- DfX principles
	- design for safety --> more than 1 limit switch to operate points
	- design for reliability --> motor hard to take apart
	- design for aesthetic --> round design, not square. This is also more ergonomic. 

How were you using Praxis models to work through tasks?
- Was not thinking about it.
- For next time,

We did a creativity activity where we explored solutions to our splartz (our bad posture)
	I found 4-3-3 method produced the highest quality ideas. It was quick (so efficient) and we built off each other. I found it helpful since it forced less verbal communication, which is helpful but can slow the entire process down. Looking at each other ideas through photos, and interpreting it may create new ideas and it's quick! The other methods we used were biomimicry. It's cool but I didn't think it was relevant to our splartz (also I don't know much about bio). The other method was the lotus blossom method, but I think it focussed too much on problem but not design
