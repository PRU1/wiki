suppose you have some carbocation.

a more stable carbocation has many electrons that can shift towards the positive charge. 

Carbon surrounded by CH3 groups has more electrons that can shift towards the positive charge than C surrounded by 3 H groups.

Hence, CCH3CH3CH3+ is a more stable than CH3+
