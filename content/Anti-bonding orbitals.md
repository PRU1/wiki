 - not really sure
 - What I think is happening:
   Take H atom and another H atom and push them into each other
   the atomic orbitals begin to overlap
	   something about Pauli's exclusion principle but you have two possible states:
	   one where proton-proton repulsion takes over
	   where when electrons line up in between nuclei and both nuclei experience electrostatic forces
	   the latter arrangement is more stable so is what forms
	   give enough energy and you promote your electrons? to the antibonding orbital
	   then H2 splits....????
	   not sure about this. There is apparently a paper on this that won a Nobel Prize



ask Ms. Almeida this: [Antibonding molecular orbital - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibonding_molecular_orbital)
