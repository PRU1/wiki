- formed by anaerobic decay of biological material
	- **anaerobic decay** is something breakdown without the presence of oxygen
- starts with prehistoric plants
- these plants got their energy through [[Photosynthesis]].
	- contains nitrogen and sulfur
- these prehistoric plants become compressed and VERY concentrated. you can release this energy through combustion.
## Coal
### Peat 
- early in decay process
- lots of water, carbon combined with H, O, S and other elements
### Lignite
25-35% carbon. high water content. 
- can polymerize to form lignin, which has a bunch of benzene rings ![[Pasted image 20240405182445.png]]
- fun fact: lignin is rigid (probably because structure has cross links holding it together)
### Bituminous coal
- sedimentary rock
- asphalt!
![[Pasted image 20240405183612.png]]
- contains H, S, and O. rock is saturated with tar-like hydrocarbon called "bitumen"
### Anthracite Coal
- hard coal, bitumen when heat + pressure is added. 92-98% C
- plentiful and cheap

When do you form crude oil instead of coal?
- Coal forms from terrestrial plants, crude oil forms from aquatic organisms. Coal is also formed in heat, crude oil is just pressure
## Crude oil
- gasoline! used in vehicles
- 5-10 C in the hydrocarbon chain

## Fractional distillation
- short chain hydrocarbons have low boiling points (low LDF because small molecule, small dipole moment because there are less electrons in the structure)
- low-boiling = volatile. Volatility means the tendency for a substance to vapourized

## Octane - branched-chain alkanes in gasoline
$$\ce{C8H18}+\ce{12.5O2} \to \ce{8CO2}+\ce{9H2O}$$
the ratio of *mass of fuel*:*mass of air* is about 15:1.
Smaller ratio: not enough oxygen for complete combustion (a lean mixture)
Larger ratio: rich mixture (you can have unreacted fuel called VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in the exhaust)

why do lean mixtures preignite? 
- hot spots inside engine
- less fuel = less cooling, so the chamber is at a higher temp. than if right ratio of air:fuel
- BOOM, while compressing pressure+temp can ignite the mixture and cause KNOCKING

### how is octane number measured?
- compress a gas until it ignites
- 2,2,4 trimethylpentane is given a score of 100
- heptane is given a score of 0.
- basically the more branched the alkane, the less likely it is to ignite 
- has to do with [[free radicals during combustion]]

# Liquid fuels from coal
- easier to transport in pipelines to homes
## Coal gasification
Coal gas
$$\ce{C(s)}+\ce{H2O(g)}\to\ce{CO(g)}+\ce{H2(g)}$$
blast coal with steam
## Coal liquification
- observation: liquid fossil fuels have a high hydrogen content
- so to liquify coal, boost hydrogen content
- or decrease C content
- basically forming hydrocarbons 
$$\ce{nC}+(n+1)\ce{H2}\to{C_nH_{2n+2}}$$
- crush coal (increase SA)
- put on top of catalyst (so that when you heat up, does not explode)
- heat up
## distillation of coal
bitumen coal has high H content
heat up to get rid of it and get rid of water

## Liquid fuels from coal gas
take coal gas and produce liquid hydrocarbons
- pass over catalyst, and up the pressure (force it to liquify)
