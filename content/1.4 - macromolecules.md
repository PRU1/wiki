- 4 types of macromolecules
- macro - big
- often polymers (monomers = M; polymer = Mn)
## Lipids
- make up cell membrane
- insulate seals
- nonpolar or largely nonpolar (so hydrophobic)
- or partly polar (amphipathic - polar part will interact with water)
- Long or small chains

## Carbohydrates
- quick form of energy
- build cell walls of plants, exoskeletons of insects
- essential part of DNA
- $\rm{CH_20}$ is the basic chemical formula of carbohydrates
- Monomers are called monosaccharides (sugars!)
- Form polymers (called glycogen/starch)
- monomers are joined together with a glycosidic bond C-O-C

## Proteins
- Made up of amino acid monomers 
	- $\alpha$-carbon (circled in red) bound to $\rm{NH_2}$ group, COOH group, a side chain (also called R group). 
	- R group is polar or non polar

Nucleic acids
- built from nucleotide monomers 
- "which consist of a phosphate group (circled in green), a sugar (circled in orange), and a base (circled in purple). Nucleotides are polar."
