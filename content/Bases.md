- proton acceptor (Bronsted-Lowry)
- electron pair donor (Lewis)
## strength of bases
$$\ce{B + H2O <=> HB+ + OH- }$$
the extent to which a base disassociates in water is given by $K_b$
$$ K_{b}= \frac{\ce{[HB+][OH-]}}{\ce{[H]}}$$
## organic bases
- have a lone pair on an atom that can bond to $\ce{H+}$
