Quick update 2024 goals
- got 44/45 (7 in English!!)
- Getting better at working
- noticed I'm slow at math and physics after a year+ gap : (

Next steps:
- become (insanely) quick with math and physics
	- both in computation and thinking. We have limited time so we should spend it doing really hard stuff, which means being strong in fundamentals
- I still struggle with big picture tasks; I work best working on one thing at a time, not multiple which is required for uni
	- I'll have to time block so I don't spend too much time doing trivial work, and make time for every course
	- I'll have to start waking up at 5 again. 4 is a bit too early to be consistent with me right now
	- I need to have a consistent study schedule: i.e. one day focus on physics + deliverable, math + deliverable, civ + deliverable, etc.. Small study sessions throughout is better than cramming
