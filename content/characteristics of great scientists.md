- "great scientists" just means that they published important research
- one characteristic is "successful scientists have courage"
- "they think and continue to think"
- problem: tend to only work on hard problems after solving and gaining recognition for solving something important
- this slows you down
- great scientists have tremendous drive
- "you would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years"
- "knowledge and productivity are like compound interest" --> work just 10% harder than the next person and you will more than twice outproduce someone
- the more you know the more you learn
- there is no difference in the ability of those two people, just one got more thinking in, and was much more productive over a lifetime
- "you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done" <-- sorry sleep (don't want to neglect other things)
- keep track of flaws in your theories --> be sensible
- ask yourself "what are the most important problems in my field"
	- work on important problems so you do important work
- work with the door open - may be less productive but you get clues on what is important from the interruptions
- “It is a poor workman who blames his tools - the good man gets on with the job, given what he’s got, and gets the best answer he can.”
- WRITE CLEARLY so people can understand your work
- learn to give formal talks (prepared)
- learn to give informal talks (like in the middle of a conference. giving your idea after the conference because you couldn't talk is too late)
- if you want to go further recognize that you cannot have total control; you need to support the system you are in.
- don't have to fight the system all the time, rather learn to work with it and take advantage of what the system has to offer
