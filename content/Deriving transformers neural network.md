[[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)]] are cool, but why are CNNs bad at NLP?
CNNs in image processing yay
researchers tried CNNs in NLP
- i.e. translating
- CNNs were unusable for text
why?
- difference: text is not described as # s
- but NNs need numbers as inputs
- one hot encoding: words are assigned a vector 
- conv
